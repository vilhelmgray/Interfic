Interfic reads and creates interactive fiction.

FIC File Format
---------------

At the heart of Interfic is the FIC file format. Each FIC file consists
of a header followed by a number of "page" entries. The header consists
of the magic ASCII byte sequence ("INTERFIC") followed by a version
byte; the header is 9 bytes in size.

A page entry consists of 1024 bytes of text followed by 4 "choice"
entries, each having a size of 259 bytes; a page entry is 2060 bytes in
size. If a null byte is the first byte of a page entry, the page entry
is considered an "empty page" entry.

A choice entry consists of 256 bytes of text followed by 3 bytes
representing the number of the page entry to where the choice entry
points. If a null byte is the first byte of a choice entry, the choice
entry is considered an "empty choice" entry.
